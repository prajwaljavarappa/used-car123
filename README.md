# Used Car Price Prediction Data Science Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features of used cars such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition, among others. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a used car based on its characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [insert dataset source]. It consists of [insert number of samples] samples and [insert number of features] features. The features include:
- Make: The manufacturer of the car
- Model: The model of the car
- Year: The manufacturing year of the car
- Mileage: The total mileage of the car
- Condition: The condition of the car (e.g., excellent, good, fair)
- Fuel Type: The type of fuel used by the car
- Transmission: The transmission type of the car
- Engine Size: The size of the car's engine
- ... [add more features if applicable]
